The following describes the requirements and usage of URLPing.

===Requirements===
 * Java SE - URLPing is designed to run on Java SE 5.0 and later.

===Library Dependencies===
 * [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient Commons HttpClient]
 * [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging Commons Logging]
 * [http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/codec Commons Codec]
 
===Usage===
{{{URLPing}}} is the main class. This class provides two methods {{{ping(String url)}}} and {{{ping(String url, int timeout)}}}. The first method accepts a URL to ping and defaults to a timeout of 30 seconds. The second method accepts a timeout interval in seconds in addition to the URL to ping. 

{{{
URLPing urlPing = new URLPing();
PingResponse pingResponse = urlPing.ping("http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk");
        
assertEquals(pingResponse.getResponseStatus(), ResponseStatus.OKAY);
}}}

The response to the {{{ping}}} method is a {{{PingReponse}}} object. This contains a {{{ResponseStatus}}} enum with values of either {{{OKAY}}}, {{{ERROR}}} or {{{TIMEOUT}}} depending on the outcome of the ping. It also contains a {{{responseCode}}} property which contains the response code of the HTTP request.
